- 👋 Hi, I’m @SamucaLucas 🎮🧑🏽‍💻
- 👀 I'm interested in the area of ​​game development, such as Game Design, but until that happens, I intend to work with Beck-End. 🎮
- 📖 Hobbies: Outside of the IT area, I am a writer in my spare time, I have a book in the works, and I intend to release it one day, because based on the story of my book, I want to make a game. ✍🏽
- 🌱 I'm currently learning C language, but I intend to start learning C#! 💻
- 📫 If you want to talk to me, just send a message on my Instagram direct or on my LinkedIn. 📱
- ⚡ Interesting Fact: I already developed a 2D platform game when I was 14 years old, and it was from that game that I fell in love with C#, which is why I mastered this language. 😍
