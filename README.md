👋 Hi, I’m Samuel Lucas 🎮🧑🏽‍💻


- 👀 I'm interested in the area of ​​game development, such as Game Design, but until that happens, I intend to work with Beck-End. 🎮

- 🌱 I'm currently learning C language, but I intend to start learning C#! 💻

- ⚡ Interesting Fact: I already developed a 2D platform game when I was 14 years old, and it was from that game that I fell in love with C#, which is why I mastered this language. 😍
